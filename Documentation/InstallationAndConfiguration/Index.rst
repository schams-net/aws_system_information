Installation and Configuration
------------------------------


Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The latest **stable** version of the extension is available at the `TYPO3 Extension Repository <https://extensions.typo3.org>`_ (TER). This makes it very easy to install or update the extension in the backend of TYPO3 by using the Extension Manager (**ADMIN TOOLS → Extensions**). Developers and experienced TYPO3 integrators can alternatively download the source code from the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/schams-net/aws_system_information>`_ and install the extension manually. As the third option, the extension can also be installed using `PHP composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_.

Once installed, please reload the backend.


Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No configuration is required.
